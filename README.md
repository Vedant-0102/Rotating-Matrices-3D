# Rotating-Matrices-3D

In linear algebra, a rotation matrix is a transformation matrix that is used to perform a rotation in Euclidean spa

In three-dimensional space, a rotation matrix is a 3x3 orthogonal matrix with a determinant of +1. It is used to rotate points in three-dimensional space around an axis.
